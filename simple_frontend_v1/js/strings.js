// ── strings: ALL player-facing UI copy in ONE named table (i18n-ready) ───────
// The frontend half of the "strings named and in one file" deliverable
// (FIX_ITEMS.md). Every human-readable literal the UI renders lives here under a
// descriptive key; modules import `t` and look text up by key instead of hard-
// coding it. To localize later, swap STRINGS for another language's table — no
// renderer changes needed.
//
// Convention:
//  • Keys are dotted, namespaced by area (nav.market, newgame.title, queue.pass).
//  • Values are authored ENGLISH copy. They are TRUSTED authored content, so t()
//    returns them RAW. Where a caller interpolates t() output into innerHTML next
//    to UNTRUSTED data (a player lab name/ticker), that untrusted data must STILL
//    be run through core.esc() — t() does not escape and is not meant to.
//  • `{placeholder}` tokens are filled from the params object passed to t(); a
//    placeholder with no matching param is left as-is (visible, so a missing
//    value is caught in testing rather than silently blanked).
//
// What is NOT here: dict KEYS, action ids, handler names, CSS classes, element
// ids — those are code, not copy, and centralizing them would break the wiring.
// Authored CONTENT that already lives named in the backend (warning catalog,
// advance what_it_does/risk_blurb, benchmark blurbs, feed text) arrives through
// the observation and is rendered as-is; it is the backend's strings table, not
// duplicated here.
