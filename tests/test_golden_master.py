"""Golden-master characterization test (stdlib unittest; zero deps).

The engine's correctness story is "seed + actions => bit-identical run." This
test pins that down: it plays a small matrix of scripted games to completion and
asserts that a digest of the FULL TRUE-state log (logger.turns) is unchanged.

It exists to guard behavior across the structural refactors in
plans/hashed-honking-dove.md — any refactor that shifts an RNG draw, reorders a
phase, or changes budget math will move a digest and fail here.

Record new baselines after an INTENTIONAL behavior change:
    python3 -m tests.test_golden_master --record
and paste the printed EXPECTED block back into this file.
