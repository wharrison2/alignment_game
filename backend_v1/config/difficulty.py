"""Difficulty = the WORLD axis (engine constants only) — design doc §1.

Never touches what the player is told (that's guidance, observation layer).
Produces a Constants object: a namespace copy of config.constants with the
DIFFICULTY_SCALED subset multiplied by per-setting factors.

Realistic is the default and is tuned so a first-time player is unlikely to
win on attempt one. Impossible is barely winnable (open #12: kept winnable).
