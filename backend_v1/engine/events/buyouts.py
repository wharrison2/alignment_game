"""Buyout / relaunch event (the anti-coast mechanism).

A player can race to mid-capability, starve every rival out of the pretrain loop,
and then coast safely to victory — switching off the race the whole thesis
depends on. This phase prevents that. When the market concentrates around a
dominant leader, a struggling rival is ACQUIRED: recapitalized, renamed, and
relaunched as a hungry, corner-cutting entrant that races for the frontier
again.

The relaunch reuses the moribund lab's existing slot — `lab.id` is stable, so
every id-keyed system (market caps, observations, controllers, litigation) is
untouched; only the display name, cash, and disposition change. The board can
never be permanently cleared.
