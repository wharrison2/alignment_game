"""GameState (DATA) + GameEngine (stateless step) — §11 decision.

GameState is the complete TRUE world; the engine orchestrates the turn
pipeline and builds per-actor observations. step() mutates the passed state in
place and returns (state, observations) — replayability comes from seed +
action log, not structural immutability (see NOTES.md).

# engine, and they flow on to the frontend (legend, panels) and into observations.
# They are PUBLIC/legible (no firewall-secrecy concern), but they ARE untrusted
# input, so every value is clamped here before a Lab is constructed. The frontend
# escapes them again at render time (defence in depth); this layer guarantees the
# stored value is bounded and free of control characters regardless of the caller
# (server, CLI, or a test), so client-side checks are never the only line.
# DEFAULT_PLAYER_LAB_NAME / DEFAULT_PLAYER_TICKER are the player-facing default
# identity strings; they live in the centralized content table
# (backend_v1.content.strings) and are imported above. Re-exported here so the
# existing `from backend_v1.engine.game import DEFAULT_PLAYER_*` call sites keep
# working — the values are unchanged, only their authored SOURCE moved.
