"""ResearchProcess (§8b): in-progress research effort, ticked by the engine.

Covers BOTH capability-tree advances and safety projects (same scheduling
machinery; they differ in what completion emits). AI-assist reduces the
budget fraction (the incentive) and widens duration variance (anti-dithering),
and is the contamination vector for capability advances / the
finding-reliability degrader for safety projects.
